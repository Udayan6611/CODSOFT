# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction | CodSoft Internship â€” Task 1

This project predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster using real-world passenger data and machine learning techniques.

While the Titanic dataset is a classic, this version goes further than most:
- ðŸ“Š Visualizes how age, gender, fare, and class influenced survival
- ðŸ§  Compares three ML models and selects the best
- ðŸ’¡ Deploys an interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

> Can we predict survival on the Titanic based on a passengerâ€™s attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare?

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis

Hereâ€™s how various features influenced survival:

| Gender-based Survival | Age Distributions |
|-----------------------|-------------------|

| Passenger Class Impact | Fare Distribution |

| Correlation Matrix |

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models

| Model                   | Status      |
|------------------------|-------------|
| âœ… Random Forest        | âœ… **Saved + Deployed** |
| Logistic Regression     | âœ… Trained |
| k-NN (k=5)              | âœ… Trained |

We trained all three models, evaluated them using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report â€” and selected **Random Forest** for its balanced performance.

## ðŸ’» Streamlit Web App (Local)

You can run the prediction app on your machine using:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
